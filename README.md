Hi there,

I find there are sometimes huge knowledge gap between those who code and those who don't. I myself come from a Finance Background, 
before entering college, I knew nothing about coding as well as finance, both of these subjects seemed mysterious to me.

From a outsider's point of view, people who code are all doing similar things - there is no difference between front-end engineer and 
data analyst what's so ever.
